# School-Donation-Recommendation
The project aims to analyze complex data sets of DonorsChoose and provide recommendations to teacher about the top donors that may be willing to donate for a particular category. This is done through analysis of historical data and listing the top donors with most number of contributions as a donor as well as the most amount donated.
To help teachers write proposal for their projects, bag of words using natural language processing is generated in Python after data pre-processing for this particular requirement.
The project also provides success rate for each category based on the donation amount received and the proect requirement cost which will help teachers select the best category according to their need.
